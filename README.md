# CFMIP_LowCloudDistribution
NCL script : Comparison of vertical distribution of non-overlapped low level clouds from CFMIP Calipso simulator and CALIPSO-GOCCP.


The plots show the frequency in which tropical low-level clouds below 4km are vertically distributed in
shallow cumulus and stratocumulus regimes under non-overlapped, subsiding cloud conditions; more
specifically, when omega500hPa and omega700hPa is greater than 10 hPa day-1 and high- and mid-level cloud
cover is less than 5%.
